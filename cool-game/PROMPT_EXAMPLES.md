"This code is a game engine. Based on the code, what's the simplest game that you can devise from this"

"Write me a PLAN.md for a pretty good 2D game that you can do with this library. Go crazy"

"Based on @PLAN.md, create a detailed IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md on how you will do this breaking down in tasks. Each tasks should be small and manageable and can be easily followed by a competent engineer to take over anytime. This plan should include tests that should be done after every successful task, and should build and compile successful to ensure that the codebase is watertight. After every task is done, update it as done, and move on the to the next task. Do not write any code yet"


"Implement Phase 1 from @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. Test successfully, make sure `make run` runs successfully in the game folder, then commit the changes."


"create more robust tests for the cool-game, or find missing tests we should have"

"there's a motion blur effect when the player moves. However it looks a bit too much, and it ends up looking like a worm instead. Make the effect more
  subtle"

"implement phase 9 from @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. Use the raylib-coding skill"

"add a means to have music play on the introduction menu screen. The music should transition smoothly to the game music once the user decides to play. use
  game_intro.mp3"

"There were a few mistakes in the coding that were made in this session, such as introducing un-ncessary latency, and hidden boundaries blocking me, and also firing the projectiles had some issues. What can we do to avoid such programming mistkes in the future?"

"this is weird while playing a game, sometimes th eplayer just stops firing the bullets. Then it starts firing again only after a while. Was there something that's triggering this behaviour?"

"the mouse movement as I turn the turret feels less smooth than before and there's a perceptive lag. Also when I used the arrow keys to move my poayer, i end up blocked by a "wall". Is there a hidden wall mechanic now, or are the walls not coloured properly?"
